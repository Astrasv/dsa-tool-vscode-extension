- Stack (use :stack annotation)
- Queue (use :queue annotation)
- Linked List (use :linkedlist annotation)
- Graph (use :graph annotation)
- Tree (use :tree annotation)
-Binary Tree (use :binarytree annotation)
Each code snippet comes with necessary functions and methods, enabling you to quickly scaffold your data structure implementations.

MORE IMPLEMENTATIONS AND ALGORITHMS ARE GOING TO TO UPDATE IN NEWER VERSION


## Release Notes

1.0.0
Initial release of the DSA-Tool extension, featuring code snippets for Stack, Queue, Linked List, Graph, Tree, and Binary Tree implementations in Python.
